A simple blockchain simulator that generates 10 blocks and serializes them into a file blockchain.txt.
It also simulates gathering 100 VC for miner per block generated and transactions of VC between miners and other users.
Each block contains a hash generated by a miner.
Hash calculation simulation is based on applying sha256 hashing on a random number and looking on amount of zeros on the start of the hash.
Each thread will search for hash with amount of zeros on the start equal or higher than current amount allowed by the blockchain.
Blockchain increases the amount of zeros if time spent on block generation is lower than minimal time for block generation (1s by default).
Blockchain decreases the amount of zeros if time spent on block generation is higher than maximal time for block generation (3s by default).
After block generation, the program will output information about all the blocks into System.out.
Each next run will make the program to read the blockchain from blockchain.txt, create new blocks and append them to the blockchain.
So after two runs, on the third run it will read a blockchain with 2x blocks, and save it with 3x blocks for future.
The program creates blockchain.txt file if there is no such file for saving the blockchain.
